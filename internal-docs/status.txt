Lantern + Zeam (arm64) lean-quickstart status

Findings
- Local Lantern image (lantern:local) builds and runs on arm64.
- Zeam rebuilt for arm64 (image: zeam:arm64) so it no longer SIGILLs under qemu.
- Both nodes start; initial req/resp status handshake succeeds.
- Fixed lean_blocks_by_root SSZ encoding bug in Lantern (added offset + legacy fallback). Zeam now decodes the request without OutOfMemory/deserialization dumps; Lantern no longer hits err=-3/-5 on the first blocks_by_root request.
- In latest run (genesis_time=1763865713), Lantern requests block 0x607d…3b13, Zeam responds “not found”; the peer still disconnects shortly after, so gossip remains at 0 peers and publishes keep failing with InsufficientPeers.

How to re-run the 1-lantern + 1-zeam devnet
0) Prereqs: Docker running; repository root = lantern/.
1) Build images (only needed once or after code changes):
   - Lantern:  docker build -t lantern:local .
   - Zeam arm64: (already cloned in tools/lean-quickstart/zeam-src)
       docker build --platform linux/arm64 -t zeam:arm64 tools/lean-quickstart/zeam-src <- DO NOT RUN THIS AGAIN
2) Generate fresh genesis + run nodes:
   cd tools/lean-quickstart
   NETWORK_DIR=local-devnet DOCKER_PULL_POLICY=missing ./spin-node.sh --node lantern_0,zeam_0 --generateGenesis
   (omit --generateGenesis for subsequent runs if you don’t need fresh genesis time)
3) Observe logs:
   docker logs -f lantern_0
   docker logs -f zeam_0
4) Cleanup:
   docker rm -f lantern_0 zeam_0

Current issue to fix
- After the decode fix, peers still disconnect and gossip stays at 0; Zeam can’t serve the requested block (not found). Need to keep the connection alive and get at least one block/attestation exchange so gossipsub has peers (e.g., ensure block availability or adjust sync/keepalive behaviour).
